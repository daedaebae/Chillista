## 🔨 Phase 2: Construction Site
Building a cart takes sweat equity. 
*   **Energy**: You have a limited pool of energy. It regenerates over time.
*   **Action**: Click the **HAMMER!** button to spend energy and build progress.
*   **Goal**: Reach 100% progress to finish the chassis.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Launch Pad
Finalize your business identity.
*   **Branding**: Enter a custom name for your coffee shop. This will appear in menus and dialogue.
*   **Launch**: Clicking "Launch Business" will start the main game simulation with your selected stats and Remaining Funds.

## Strategy Tips
*   **Watch your Budget**: Different blueprints have different base costs. Cheaper carts leave you with more starting cash for ingredients!
*   **Patience**: Don't spam the hammer button if you're out of energy. Wait for the recharge.
