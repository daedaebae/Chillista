# Chillista Origins: The Cart Builder
**Proposal for a Prequel Mini-Game**

## Overview
Before the first cup is served, the cart must be built. This mini-game focuses on the **DIY journey** of creating a coffee startup from scratch. Players will make critical choices in **Design, Construction, and Implementation** that define their starting stats, reputation, and aesthetic in the main game.

## Phase 1: The Blueprint (Design Options)
*Choose your chassis. This defines your mobility, capacity, and initial vibe.*

### Option A: The "Velo-Barista" (Cargo Bike)
* **Inspiration:** Copenhagen / Portland / Amsterdam
* **Description:** A heavy-duty, reverse-trike cargo bicycle modified to hold an espresso machine on the front box.
* **Pros:** High Mobility, No Fuel Costs, "Eco-Friendly" Reputation Bonus.
* **Cons:** Limited Inventory Space, Low Water Capacity.
* **Aesthetic:** Light pine wood, matte black frame, leather geometric panniers.

### Option B: The "Sidewalk Hacker" (Upcycled Push-Cart)
* **Inspiration:** Bangkok / Berlin / Mexico City
* **Description:** A salvaged industrial cart or modified hawker stall welded with custom shelving and a roof.
* **Pros:** High Durability, Customizable Layout, "Street Cred" Reputation Bonus.
* **Cons:** Heavy to move, requires flat ground.
* **Aesthetic:** Corrugated metal, neon signage, sticker-bombed surfaces, milk crate shelving.

### Option C: The "Micro-Luxe" (Converted Piaggio/Trailer)
* **Inspiration:** Rome / Tokyo / Paris
* **Description:** A tiny, vintage three-wheeled vehicle or teardrop trailer stripped and refitted with marble surfaces.
* **Pros:** High Appeal (starts with higher prices), Weather Protection, "Premium" Reputation Bonus.
* **Cons:** High Startup Cost, Fuel/Maintenance required.
* **Aesthetic:** Pastel gloss paint, brass fittings, marble countertop, pinstriping.

## Phase 2: The Build (Construction Gameplay)
*Turn sketches into reality. Speed and precision matter.*

### 🛠️ Mechanics
Instead of instant building, the player performs "Construction Actions" which cost **Energy** and **Money**.
1.  **Sourcing Materials**:
    *   *Dumpster Dive* (Free, High Risk of bad quality)
    *   *Marketplace Scour* (Medium Cost, Time consuming)
    *   *Premium Supplier* (High Cost, Perfect Quality)
2.  **Assembly Minigames**:
    *   **Sawing/Cutting**: Rhythm game to cut wood/metal to size. Mistakes waste material.
    *   **Painting**: Cursor-tracing game to apply even coats.
    *   **Plumbing**: Puzzle game (Pipe mania style) to connect water tanks to the machine without leaks.

### 💡 Customization Choices
*   **Power Source**: Car Battery array (Silent/Limited) vs. Gas Generator (Loud/Unlimited) vs. Solar Roof (Expensive/Slow).
*   **Water System**: Gravity fed (Cheap/Slow flow) vs. Pressure Pump (Expensive/Consistent).

## Phase 3: The Launch (Implementation)
*The cart is built. Now, make it a business.*

### 📋 Bureaucracy & Branding
1.  **The Permit Puzzle**: A logic puzzle where you must fit your cart's dimensions and safety features into the local city council's strict grid requirements.
    *   *Fail?* You operate "Underground" (Risk of fines, higher "Cool" factor).
    *   *Pass?* You get a "Certified" sticker (Safe, higher trust).
2.  **Brand Identity**:
    *   **Logo Creator**: Simple pixel-art editor or layered stamp tool (Hipster Crossed Arrows, Minimalist Sans-Serif, or Retro Mascot).
    *   **Social Media Hype**: Choose your platform strategy.
        *   *Insta-Glam*: Focus on latte art photos.
        *   *Tok-Trend*: Focus on "Behind the Build" videos.
        *   *Local-Blog*: Invite the cranky food critic.

## Integration with Chillista (Main Game)
Completing the Mini-Game generates a `Save File` that imports into Chillista:
*   **Starting Skin**: Your custom cart visuals.
*   **Starting Perks**:
    *   *Eco-Bike* -> Faster brewing speed (Manual labor buff).
    *   *Street Cart* -> Cheaper ingredients (Sourcing connection).
    *   *Luxe Cart* -> Higher tips (Aesthetic appeal).
*   **Starting Debt**: Directly related to how much you spent on the build.
